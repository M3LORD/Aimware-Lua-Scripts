# Standalone Scripts
Scripts that dont need their own dedicated folder and documentation.

## [World Modulation](modulation.lua)
The World Modulation script gives you access to control how the map looks, with sliders for changing ambient lighting and bloom scale. (VISUALS -> MISC -> World)

## [Matchmaking Region Selector](regionselector.lua)
This script gives you a plethora of matchmaking locations to choose, which will force you to matchmake in that region. All without changing firewall settings :)

## [Peek Assistance](peekassist.lua)
A key bind that when held inverts your moment when you begin shooting. Useful for scouting, though its current implementation is not great.

## [Pulsating Elements](pulse.lua)
This is also a simple script that changes the opacity of certain GUI elements. By default, it changes the opacity of the history, CT and T chams, creating a pulsating effect.

The speed and range is changeable through editing the script's speed, min and max variables.
