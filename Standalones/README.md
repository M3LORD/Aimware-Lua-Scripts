# Standalone Scripts
Scripts that dont need their own dedicated folder and documentation.

## [Matchmaking Region Selector](regionselector.lua)
This script gives you a plethora of matchmaking locations to choose, which will force you to matchmake in that region. All without changing firewall settings :)

## [Peek Assistance](peekassist.lua)
A key bind that when held inverts your moment when you begin shooting. Useful for scouting, though its current implementation is not great.
